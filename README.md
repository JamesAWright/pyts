pyts is a Python package for time series transformation and classification. It
aims to provide state-of-the-art as well as recently published algorithms
for time series classification. Most of these algorithms transform time series,
thus pyts provides several tools to perform these transformations.

## Installation

### Dependencies

pyts requires:

- Python (>= 3.5)
- NumPy (>= 1.15.4)
- SciPy (>= 1.1.0)
- scikit-learn (>=0.20.1)
- Numba (>0.41.0)

To run the examples Matplotlib (>=2.0.0) is required.

### User installation

If you already have a working installation of numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and
numba, you can easily install pyts using ``pip``

    pip install pyts

You can also get the latest version of pyts by cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts.git
    cd pyts
    pip install .
